## Jest Adaptor to help write Pact files with ease

### Features

- [x] instantiates the PactOptions for you
- [x] Setups Pact mock service before and after hooks so you donâ€™t have to
- [x] Assign random ports and pass port back to user so we can run in parallel without port clashes
- [x] Set Jasmine's timeout to 30 seconds preventing brittle tests in slow environments

## `Jest-Pact` Roadmap

- [ ] user configurable paths for log/pact output dirs
- [ ] integration with Jest's API to make setup and teardown of pact tests very simple
- [ ] Ensure that jest-pact plays well with jest's default of watch-mode
- [ ] Ensure that pact failures print nice diffs (at the moment you have to go digging in the log files)

## Adapter Installation

```sh
npm i jest-pact --save-dev

OR

yarn add jest-pact --dev
```

If you have more than one file with pact tests for the same consumer/provider
pair, you will also need to add `--runInBand` to your `jest` or `react-scripts test` command in your package.json. This avoids race conditions with the mock
server writing to the pact file.

## Usage

Say that your API layer looks something like this:

```js
import axios from 'axios';

const defaultBaseUrl = 'http://your-api.example.com';

export const api = (baseUrl = defaultBaseUrl) => ({
  getHealth: () =>
    axios.get(`${baseUrl}/health`).then((response) => response.data.status),
  /* other endpoints here */
});
```

Then your test might look like:

```js
import { pactWith } from 'jest-pact';
import { Matchers } from '@pact-foundation/pact';
import api from 'yourCode';

pactWith({ consumer: 'MyConsumer', provider: 'MyProvider' }, provider => {
  let client;

  beforeEach(() => {
    client = api(provider.mockService.baseUrl)
  });

  describe('health endpoint', () => {
    // Here we set up the interaction that the Pact
    // mock provider will expect.
    //
    // jest-pact takes care of validating and tearing
    // down the provider for you.
    beforeEach(() =>
      provider.addInteraction({
        state: "Server is healthy",
        uponReceiving: 'A request for API health',
        willRespondWith: {
          status: 200,
          body: {
            status: Matchers.like('up'),
          },
        },
        withRequest: {
          method: 'GET',
          path: '/health',
        },
      })
    );

    // You also test that the API returns the correct
    // response to the data layer.
    //
    // Although Pact will ensure that the provider
    // returned the expected object, you need to test that
    // your code recieves the right object.
    //
    // This is often the same as the object that was
    // in the network response, but (as illustrated
    // here) not always.
    it('returns server health', () =>
      client.health().then(health => {
        expect(health).toEqual('up');
      }));
  });
```

# Best practices

You can make your tests easier to read by extracting your request and responses:

```js
/* pact.fixtures.js */
import { Matchers } from '@pact-foundation/pact';

export const healthRequest = {
  uponReceiving: 'A request for API health',
  withRequest: {
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/health',
  },
};

export const healthyResponse = {
  status: 200,
  body: {
    status: Matchers.like('up'),
  },
};
```

```js
import { pactWith } from 'jest-pact';
import { healthRequest, healthyResponse } from "./pact.fixtures";

import api from 'yourCode';

pactWith({ consumer: 'MyConsumer', provider: 'MyProvider' }, provider => {
  let client;

  beforeEach(() => {
    client = api(provider.mockService.baseUrl)
  });

  describe('health endpoint', () => {

    beforeEach(() =>
      provider.addInteraction({
        state: "Server is healthy",
        ...healthRequest,
        willRespondWith: healthyResponse
      })
    );

    it('returns server health', () =>
      client.health().then(health => {
        expect(health).toEqual('up');
      }));
  });
```

# API Documentation

Jest-Pact has three functions:

- `pactWith(JestPactOptions, (providerMock) => { /* tests go here */ })`: a wrapper that sets up a pact mock provider
- `xpactWith(JestPactOptions, (providerMock) => { /* tests go here */ })`: Like `xdescribe` in Jest, this skips the pact tests described within.
- `fpactWith(JestPactOptions, (providerMock) => { /* tests go here */ })`: Like `fdescribe` in Jest, this sets this test suite to only run this test.

There are two types exported:

- `JestProvidedPactFn`: This is the type of the second argument to `pactWith`, ie: `(provider: Pact) => void`
- `JestPactOptions`: An extended version of `PactOptions` that has some additional convienience options (see below).

## Configuration

You can use all the usual `PactOptions` from pact-js, plus a timeout for
telling jest to wait a bit longer for pact to start and run.

```ts
pactWith(JestPactOptions, provider => {
    // regular pact tests go here
}

interface JestPactOptions = PactOptions & {
  timeout?: number; // Timeout for pact service start/teardown, expressed in milliseconds
                    // Default is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
  logDir?: string; // path for the log file
  logFileName?: string; // filename for the log file
}
```

### Defaults

Jest-Pact sets some helpful default PactOptions for you. You can override any of these by explicitly setting corresponding option. Here are the defaults:

- `log` is set so that log files are written to /pact/logs, and named `<consumer>-<provider>-mockserver-interaction.log`
- `dir` is set so that pact files are written to /pact/pacts
- `logLevel` is set to warn
- `timeout` is 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds)
- `pactfileWriteMode` is set to "update"

Most of the time you won't need to change these.

A common use case for `log` is to change only the filename or the path for
logging. To help with this, Jest-Pact provides convienience options `logDir`
and `logFileName`. These allow you to set the path or the filename
independently. In case you're wondering, if you specify `log`, `logDir` and
`logFileName`, the convienience options are ignored and `log` takes
precidence.

### Jest Watch Mode

By default Jest will watch all your files for changes, which means it will run in an infinite loop as your pact tests will generate json pact files and log files.

You can get around this by using the following `watchPathIgnorePatterns: ["pact/logs/*","pact/pacts/*"]` in your `jest.config.js`

Example

```js
module.exports = {
  testMatch: ['**/*.test.(ts|js)', '**/*.it.(ts|js)', '**/*.pacttest.(ts|js)'],
  watchPathIgnorePatterns: ['pact/logs/*', 'pact/pacts/*'],
};
```

You can now run your tests with `jest --watch` and when you change a pact file, or your source code, your pact tests will run

### Examples of usage of `jest-pact`

See [Jest-Pact-Typescript](https://github.com/YOU54F/jest-pact-typescript) which showcases a full consumer workflow written in Typescript with Jest, using this adaptor

- [x] Example pact tests
  - [x] AWS v4 Signed API Gateway Provider
  - [x] Soap API provider
  - [x] File upload API provider
  - [x] JSON API provider

#### Examples Installation

- clone repository `git@github.com:YOU54F/jest-pact-typescript.git`
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn run pact-test`

Generated pacts will be output in `pact/pacts`
Log files will be output in `pact/logs`
